## html css deliverable notes
 using bootstrap is SO much easier.. do it
 making small subtle changes towards your desired product is the best way to approach design, don't try to do too much too fast
 don't be afraid to take inspiration! there is so much out there you can use and base your code off of

 bootstrap has great documentation, use it often and with purpose
## JS deliverable notes

writing js inline with <script> allows for easy single use functions to be defined without making a seperate file
using the DOM allows for the powerful ablity to manipulate HTML using javascript
try to reuse functions to minimize extraneous code
using local memory cannot save to a database


## Service deliverable notes
when working with websockets, using http will require extra code to set up the server
MongoDB works very well with javascript thanks to the use of JSON
endpoints provide lots of resources for accessing data from other places













## github notes
 learned how to effectivley navigate git using both the vs code extension and the command line
 also figured out how to resolve a merge in a git repo!


# Elevator Pitch
## The world of recipe blogging is bloated and needs a complete redesign.
## I plan to create a website that cuts out the all the storytelling bloat that comes with a recipe blog and provide home cooks around the world a centralized recipe sharing site that prioritizes the recipe, not the story behind it. 


# User oriented recipe sharing site
# Features
## Allow users to sort recipes by meal, cuisine and other specification.
## Recipe search functionality.
## Concise ingredient and instruction delivery
### Story behind the recipe comes second. Prioritizes easily accessable information
## Allow users to "branch" recipes and repost with modifications
### Similar to GitHub fork functionality
## Social aspect of website
### Allow users to share recipes on their page
### Instagram Style explore page that displays shared recipes in an appealing format
### Social media integration
## Support for video upload and youtube links
### Allow the users to upload their own videos to the site or pull existing links from Youtube.
